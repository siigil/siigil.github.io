Hi! I‚Äôm a Cloud Security practitioner, currently working as part of a multi-national corporate blue team. I believe in having both offensive and defensive mindsets to approach cybersecurity right, and have dedicated myself to this over the past 8 years with dedicated roles in penetration testing, incident response, security engineering, and application security across both internal and consulting functions.

I earned my BS in Electrical Engineering from Rochester Intitute of Technology (RIT), and hold OSCP, GPEN, GCSA, Azure Security Engineer Associate, and Azure Administrator Associate certifications.

I find it helpful to share what I‚Äôve learned through my talks and writing. This creates an archive of advice to share with others, but also forces me to document my notes! My areas of focus are cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP), containers, DevOps technologies, and general career reflections.

Thanks for stopping by, & hope you have a great day. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
