Hi! I'm a Cloud Security practitioner. In my current role, I apply my background in security to research Azure cloud security, and develop new methods of identifying cloud risk and stopping attackers targeting these environments.

My previous work experience includes Penetration Testing (Web, Network, AD, Mobile), Security Consulting (Bug Bounty, Application Security), SoC & Incident Response, and Security Engineering (Network, Email, Cloud, Application). I have earned OSCP, GPEN, GCSA, AZ-104 (Azure Administrator Associate), and AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer Associate) certifications, and hold a BS in Electrical Engineering from RIT.

I'm passionate about keeping new technology secure, coaching technical excellence, and fostering professional skills for those newer to the field.

Documenting what I‚Äôve learned through on this blog allows me to:
1. Capture my own technology notes as I learn
2. Share advice I've provided to mentees
3. Reflect on lessons learned

This creates an archive I can share with others, but also forces me to document where I've been! My current areas of technical focus are cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP), containers, and DevOps technologies.

Thanks for stopping by. Hope you have a great day! üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
