The Azure Resource Graph Explorer is a great way to quickly understand your Azure netework exposure. Simple KQL queries let you review all your resources at once, free of charge! More complex joins can allow reviews of VM exposure, complete with VM IP address.

As a part of the Cloud Secuirty Podcast's ["Advent of Cloud Security"](https://advent.cloudsecuritypodcast.tv/), I created a small lab exercise to get you started on all your Resource Graph Explorer KQL adventures.

The repository for this lab is here: 
- ["Azure KQL Security Review: Demo Environment"](https://github.com/siigil/azure-kql-demo)

My video walkthrough of this lab as part of the advent festivities is available here:
- ["Azure Security Assessments Using Resource Graph Explorer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqNsmfaBZ6Y)

The cost to run this should be under $5 for the hour or two you'll end up playing with this. You can also run the KQL demo queries against your own environment, they're all available in the repository here:

Happy holidays!! ❄️
